# Introduction 

Writing code using only CMSIS for taking a potentiometer value and using ADC to read and display the values, the values will be displayed via a UART Serial Monitor using a USB to UART TTL converter. 
Step 2 would be using these ADC value to control a PWM wave to fade an external LED.
